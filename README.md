# About The Project
The goal of the project was to create an AI that was able to learn to play the videogame Pong in 3D from scratch with the use of reinforced learning. It was developed in Unity 3D with the use of Tensorflow  and I did it all by myself.

# Description
At the start of the project, the agent knows nothing about the game. By trial and error and after a learning process of about 15 minutes, the agent was able to move correctly to hit the ball. The video shows a match between two AI trained in the same way.
